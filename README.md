# JSHeroes Bootcamp - Frontend starter

This is the basic starter for getting into frontend development. It consists of some config files (package.json, package-lock.json) and a `src` folder with the 3 main files we'll be writing code in:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
 
Both style and script files are already loaded in the main html file. The html file can be open directly in the browser or via a static server by running the following command in a terminal:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

If you prefer running the repo in the cloud:

## What we build

The goal of the bootcamp is for everyone to build a GitHub explorer web application. We'll be using the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch data and implement the following functionality on top of this starter:
- Build a static page with semantic HTML elements
- Style your html tags [following this design](https://basic-frontend-starter-4colkgz3i-jsheroes.vercel.app/)
- Use JavaScript to dynamically insert tags into your HTML (DOM manipulation)
- Fetch GitHub data from an external API
- Implement search by name

## Useful Information

### GitHub API documentation

#### Get most popular repositories
When you don't have a search term, you can use this request to get the most popular repos on GitHub.
* **Docs** : https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search#search-repositories
* **URL** : `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:>10000"`
* **Method** : `GET`

#### Search repositories
The same request can be used to search by a term (eg: "react").
* **Docs** : https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search#search-repositories
* **URL** : `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=react`
* **Method** : `GET`
